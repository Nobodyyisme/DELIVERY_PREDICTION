# 🚚 Delivery Prediction Project

This project is a machine learning-based system to **predict delivery outcomes** using voting classifiers. It includes a trained model (`voting_model.pkl`), a simple UI (`ui.py`), and some example input/output files for testing and documentation.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

Create a virtual environment (optional):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> _Note: If `requirements.txt` is missing, you may need to install common packages like `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `joblib`, etc._

---

### 2. Run the App

```bash
python ui.py
```

This will launch a basic interface or script that uses the trained `voting_model.pkl` to predict delivery success/failure.
